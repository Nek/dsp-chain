========

A library for sound Digital Signal Processing, written in Rust

Goals
-----

- A generic synthesis engine offering both additive and FM synthesis tools.
- A powerful sampler with granular synthesis capabilities.
- To create a large collection of effects (including reverberation, delay-lines, spatial processing).
- To bring all of the above together with an easy-to-use signal chain.
